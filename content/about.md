Currently working as a UI designer as a part of the international team in the Digital Experience Group at <a href="https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wolters Kluwer</a> in Warsaw.

Before, together with my Design Team, I was building a Design System for the biggest Polish Bank, <a href="https://www.pkobp.pl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PKO BP</a>.

I graduated from <a href="https://ironhack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ironhack</a> in Berlin, which I did to develop my career in tech field.
I also have a university degree in French and English.

I'm especially interested in user-centered and visual design. I'm always open for new challenging opportunities and collaborations, both stationary and remote. I feel great as a part of international environment and enjoy working with motivated and creative people.
