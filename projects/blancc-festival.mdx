<Section title="Problem statement">

Success of an event or a festival depends on two main factors: planning and promotion. Event’s digital presence is as important as the event itself — people can feel the vibe of it before it happens, learn what they will experience, and, most importantgly, buy a ticket. The most effective way of connecting participants with their favorite festivals and artists is through a website. Previous website definitely was outdated and the user were confused by the navigation and the ticket process. It was also not possible to book a parking spot online.

<Section title="UX Research" img="blancc-news-desktop.png" altImg="News">

A study done by Eventbrite and MusicWatch, analyzed the data about today’s growth in music festivals. Surveying over 1,000 people ages 18–49 helped to prove that each person attended at least one music festival in the past years. Usually, a user visits the website of an event to check the line up and infromation about it. The primary goal is usually buying a festival ticket. Besides the surveys, I was able to conduct a few interviews that provided supplemental qualitative data to my research. It was clear that the users are confused by the website navigation and the ticket process. I found out that many music festival websites are lacking a clear information architecture and they are flooded with content and are also not consistent, which made it very hard for the users to navigate. During the design process and testing, the User Flow has been limited to a few easy steps that helps the festival fans to achieve their goals.

<Section title="Logo & brand attributes" img="blancc-logo.png" altImg="Logo Blancc">

Logo for a festival does not need a symbol alongside a wordmark. The brand name on its own is enough, particularly with a distinctive one, such as Blancc Music Festival. It unites different genres celebrating cultural and musical diversity. I created an elastic graphic identity that can adapt to various circumstances and represent different elements of the festival such as musical genres, location or year.
